<h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>
<br>
<p>These Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Terms”)
govern your use of the MNDFL Website (the “Website”). The Website is designed
to allow users to make class and class package purchases, register for classes,
buy merchandise, and communicate with Nest Level LLC (d/b/a MNDFL) (“MNDFL”).
<br>
<br>
<h3>General Statement on Privacy, Personal Data, and Communications</h3>
<br>
<p>If you use the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your account, password, and for restricting access to your
computer or device. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that
occur under your account and password.
<p>When you visit the Website or communicate with MNDFL via email, you are
communicating electronically. You consent to receive communications from MNDFL
electronically. MNDFL will communicate with you by email or by posting
notifications on the Website. You understand and agree that all agreements,
notices, disclosures, and other communications that MNDFL provides
electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in
writing.
<br>
<br>
<h3>User Provided Information</h3>
<br>
<p>MNDFL does not collect any personal information about individuals – such as
names and postal codes, home addresses, and email addresses – except when such
information is knowingly provided to MNDFL. Personal information might be
obtained from online transactions such as class and class package purchases,
retail purchases, and/or class registrations. Additionally, personal
information may be transmitted as part of a form submission or in connection
with other activities or services made available on the Website. Any personal
identification information retrieved by MNDFL must be voluntarily submitted by
the user.
<p>MNDFL may use the information provided to contact you with important
information, required notices, and marketing promotions.  You may always choose
to opt-out of any of these notices (other than those required by applicable
law, rule or regulation) by selecting to do so at the bottom of each email you
receive from us or by emailing us directly.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<br>
<p>The Website collects some anonymous information about users automatically
when individuals request pages through a browser. This information is used to
keep track of the shopping cart and to help us monitor how individuals use the
Website, which allows MNDFL to provide an optimal experience and better service
throughout the online offerings. The information collected automatically by the
server does not contain anything that can identify individuals personally, such
as an email or home address.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Security Statement</h3>
<br>
<p>MNDFL makes every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur
on the Website are secure. All credit card numbers and transactions are
encrypted using 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. We are concerned
about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide
physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we
process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to
authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order
to operate, develop or improve the Website. Please be aware that, although we
endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and
maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
<br>
<br>
<h3>What is a Secure Connection?</h3>
<br>
<p>When a secure connection is established between your browser and a website,
any data that is transferred over the connection will be encrypted to prevent
it from being viewed by a third party. SSL encryption makes it very difficult
for anyone to intercept or decode messages exchanged over this type of secure
connection.
<p>Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari display an image of
a locked padlock on their status bar when connected to a secure site. Google
Chrome shows a green locked padlock on the far left side of the status bar when
there is a secure SSL connection. Firefox colors the address bar yellow when
connected to a secure site. Secure transactions are also indicated when the
prefix in the location bar of your browser switches from http:// or https://.
The additional ‘s’ stands for ‘secure’ and indicates a secure connection to the
MNDFL website. If you do not see this padlock, if it is unlocked, or if the
protocol in the location bar is not listed as https://, then any data exchanged
with the website is potentially visible to others.
<p>Depending on your browser, you may be able to view authentication
information about a secure page by double-clicking on the padlock icon in the
status bar. For more information on how your software establishes a secure
connection, see the help files for your particular browser.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<br>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a website
and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies cannot read data from your
hard disk or read cookie files that were created by other sites – the website
that creates a cookie is the only one a browser will permit to access it.
<p>Like many other websites and applications, the Website uses cookies to
obtain certain types of information. For example, MNDFL might use cookies to
control access to certain features such as your password and account, to
customize content areas, or to analyze site activity and user behavior. MNDFL
reserves the right to use cookies in the future in conjunction with new content
or expanded functionality.
<p>If you are concerned about the use of cookies, you can explore your web
browser’s options to notify you whenever a cookie is set, or to disallow
cookies altogether. You should be aware that prohibiting the use of cookies
will significantly restrict access to certain types of content or features.
<br>
<br>
<h3>How Information is Used</h3>
<br>
<p>The following are examples of how MNDFL might use the personal information
collected through the Website:
    <ul>
    <li>	If you purchase MNDFL classes or a package of classes, sign up for
    a MNDFL class, or purchase MNDFL retail items, the required personal
    information (similar to that provided during a telephone or mail order
    purchase) will be used to complete your order.
    <li>	If you indicate that you are interested in receiving MNDFL related
    news and information, you may receive emails to the email address you
    provided as part of the registration process.
    <li>	Aggregate data could be analyzed to describe the collective
    characteristics and behaviors of online visitors, and subsequently be used
    to further optimize the effectiveness of the Website and the overall MNDFL
    experience.
</ul>
<p>You can help MNDFL maintain the accuracy of your personal information by
updating your account. Please update this information when you change your
address, phone number, or email address. MNDFL will never share telephone
numbers, email addresses, or any personal data with third parties.
<p>MNDFL reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or
edit content, or cancel orders, at its sole discretion.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Privacy of Minors</h3>
<br>
<p>If you are under 18, you may register and use the Website only with the
involvement of a parent or guardian. MNDFL does not accept the online
registration of minors; please do not attempt to register on the Website if you
are under the age of 18. Registration of a minor (ages 12-17) must be completed
in person at one of our studios with a parent or guardian. 
<p>If MNDFL discovers that personal information has been submitted by a minor
without parent or guardian approval, MNDFL reserves the right to delete such
information. MNDFL does not seek or share personal information from minors
throughout the Website.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Reservations/Charges</h3>
<br>
<p>In order to make a reservation, you must first own a single class or a
package of classes (multiple classes). To buy an individual class or package of
classes online, you can either sign up on the Website by using your email and
creating a password, or if you are already registered, click login to buy a
package and make your reservation.
<p>You should be aware that classes and packages expire, and future prices are
subject to change. We accept MasterCard, Visa, and American Express. Cash
payments may only be made in a MNDFL studio. 
<p>Your credit/debit card will be charged for your order when you submit your
reservation. MNDFL will not process reservation charges that use an incorrect,
expired, or over-the-limit credit card. We will make our best efforts to
contact you if this occurs. If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due,
services or privileges may be suspended or terminated. You shall be responsible
and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ fees and collection costs, that
MNDFL may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
<br>
<p>In order to cancel a spot reserved in a MNDFL class and return the class to
your MNDFL account, you must cancel within 5 hours of such class. If you
haven’t cancelled within 5 hours of your class, the class will not be returned
to your MNDFL account, you will be charged for the class, and you will not be
issued a refund.  If you have purchased an unlimited monthly MNDFL membership
and you have not cancelled a spot reserved in a MNDFL class within 5 hours of
the class, MNDFL reserves the right to charge your credit card on file $10 for
each such missed class.
<p>You can cancel your reservation in the following ways:
1) Log into your account and, next to the class you wish to cancel, press "unreserve."
2) Call MNDFL to cancel the class for you.
FOR PARTICIPANTS RUNNING LATE: We ask that you call us to let us know you are on the way. The front desk will hold your spot in the class for up to 5 minutes after class begins. Participants who are more than 5 minutes late may not be admitted into class if it is too disruptive.
FOR PARTICIPANTS LEAVING EARLY: If you’re planning on leaving early, we kindly request that you tell your meditation instructor ahead of time and sit in the back of the studio.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Waiver and Release</h3>

Facilities, until you furnish an opinion letter from a medical doctor, at your
sole cost and expense, specifically addressing MNDFL’s concerns and stating
that MNDFL’s concerns are unfounded.  In consideration of being allowed to
participate in and access to the Classes and Facilities, you hereby (1) agree
to assume full responsibility for any and all injuries or damage which are
sustained or aggravated by you in relation to Classes and Facilities, (2)
release, indemnify, and hold harmless MNDFL and its officers, directors,
members, employees, representatives, and agents, and each of their respective
successors and assigns and all others, from any and all responsibility, claims,
actions, suits, procedures, costs, expenses, damages, and liabilities to the
fullest extent allowed by law arising out of or in any way related to
participation in the Classes or use of the Facilities, and (3) represent that
you (a) have no medical or physical condition that would prevent you from
properly using any of MNDFL’s Classes or Facilities, (b) do not have a physical
or mental condition that would put you in any physical or medical danger, and
(c) have not been instructed by a physician to not participate in meditation or
similar classes.
