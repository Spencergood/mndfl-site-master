He grew passionate about Buddhist practice and became involved in the Interdependence Project, where he offered some time as a facilitator and meditation teacher in the early years. Simultaneously, Juan Carlos delevoped a strong heart connection to the Shambhala teachings and embarked on its Sacred Path of Warrior. He eventually became a student of Ponlop Rinpoche and a teacher of the Buddhist curriculum at his sangha, Nalandabodhi NY. In 2009 he met non-dual spiritual teacher Gangaji, who blew his mind open. Her teachings on Self-Inquiry, a direct investigation into the Truth of Self has become his focus and permeates his view of spiritual practice. He volunteers for the Gangaji Foundation as the curator of the online video library. Finally, he is also infinitely indebted to his Jivamukti yoga teachers Rima Rabbath and Monica Jaggi for 10 years of instilling the discipline of deepening in the precious practices of asana and meditation.",

A 14 hour bus ride; an encounter with an old friend who studied Taoism; a boat ride to Stone Island off the coast of Mazatlan; and meeting a monk who taught him how to meditate changed the course of his life. He went to India for 10 months where he practiced regularly and upon returning to NY became a middle school teacher and administrator where he taught both parents and kids ways to work more skillfully with their own minds. A practitioner of Theravadan Buddhism for a decade and a half, Dan continues to find the practice of meditation awareness-expanding and heart-deepening.

While it was all well over her head at the time, it sparked a lifelong interest in Eastern thought and philosophy. Now, she finds herself a student of Shambhala Buddhism, while still learning and appreciating the wisdom from many other Buddhist lineages. \nAs Anita transitions from elementary school teacher to Art Therapist, she remains grounded in her passion to incorporate a sense of childlike wonder to all aspects of her day. She is excited about the opportunity to combine her interests in meditation, psychology and the creative process to help others navigate their inner and outer worlds. \n",
