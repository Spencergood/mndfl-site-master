            <p>Welcome to MNDFL Ed!
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>We started MNDFL Ed because, in today's world,
            mindfulness and compassion practices are important, and in
            my personal experience it's more than important - it's
            invaluable to teens and youth in NYC schools. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This project is inspired by the community and
            camaraderie that you've already seen at the MNDFL studios.
            Thousands of people, mostly adults, have experienced the
            feeling of peace, relaxation, and self reflection offered
            by our amazing teaching staff at MNDFL. My inspiration is
            to bring this experience to teens and youth - creating
            safe spaces within schools for young people to explore
            their minds and hearts, and form healthy connections with
            peers and adults. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>On a personal note, I was fortunate to be exposed to
            mindfulness as a teenager and it has stuck with me my
            whole life. My aspiration is for all young people to learn
            these tools in order to counter stress, fear, anxiety and
            everything they have to face in todayâ€™s world. 

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I hope you will join me in supporting our next
            generation of leaders to feel strong, aware, and confident
            in helping make the world a place of respect and dignity
            for all.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Warmly,
