## Instructions for updating the teacher roster

1. Please make changes to teacher information [here in the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DrVWUQ1RA2MmWtlO4CUUHd3OR5eGDwLvKL2he5XXxYY/edit#gid=0)

2. After the information is updated, the teacher's headshot must be uploaded [to the folder](https://github.com/MNDFL/mndfl-site/tree/master/assets/img/teachers/portraits). The filenames must match the existing `firstnamelastname.jpg` pattern in lowercase.
